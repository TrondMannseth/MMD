Create toy-example figures in my paper Multiscale model diagnostics (Computational Geosciences)

This project performs the calculations necessary to create each of Figs. 2â€“7 in the paper Multiscale model diagnostics by Trond Mannseth published in Computational Geosciences. To create Fig. n, uncomment the line figure = n in the file genToyExamples.py, and run it. Please contact me (trma@norceresearch.no) if necessary.
